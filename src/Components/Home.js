                <p>My name is Jacky and I offer 1 to 1 maths tuition at affordable prices.</p> 
                <p>Most parents agree that fully tailored 1 to 1 teaching is extremely efficient. I craft the lessons to ensure your child benefits and becomes more confident in maths and  to help them reach their potential.</p>
                <p>Or alternatively as an adult you regret not having a secure maths foundation in order to help your child with homework. I can help with gaps and confidence in areas needed with either regular or one-off tuition.</p> 
                <p>I offer lessons throughout Thurso in person or anywhere online.</p>
                <p> All levels of maths are covered from P3 to Higher.
