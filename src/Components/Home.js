                <p>My name is Jacky and I offer 1 to 1 maths tuition at affordable prices. 
Most parents agree that fully tailored 1 to 1 teaching is extremely efficient. I craft the lessons to ensure your child benefits and becomes more confident in maths and  to help them reach their potential. 
Or alternatively as an adult you regret not having a secure maths foundation in order to help your child with homework. I can help with gaps and confidence in areas needed with either regular or one-off tuition. 
I offer lessons throughout Thurso in person or anywhere online. 
All levels of maths are covered from P3 to Higher.
